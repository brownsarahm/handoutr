# a lightweight static site generator for  almost paper handouts

Write a page in markdown and pass it through this to generate a simple "handout" that gives users the option to work in browser, their favorite text editor, or on a pdf (designed for tablet or print, not fillable). If they work in browser they can save it as a pdf, markdown, or copy the combind markdown to their clipboard. 

This offers no submission and no tracking of users.
